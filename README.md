# MySICPSolutions  
I try to learn sicp in this winter vacation, here are my solutions to the exercises after class.  
I used DrRacket with sicp package.  
These answers are not necessarily correct, and I may not be able to solve out all the exercises.  
But you can refer to the standard solutions given at http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions  
I am using the Chinese version of sicp.  
There are some mistakes in the textbook,  
which can be found at https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/qiuzy/books/sicp/errata.htm
